# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
# Summary:
# - Moves Godot export templates into the expected location in the container.
# - Verifies critical assets exist in the repo (POSIX-safe check to catch case/path issues on Linux CI).
# - Runs Godot headlessly to (re)import assets, ensuring .import metadata exists on the runner.
# - Builds the Web export using your preset name ("Web") to build/web/index.html.
# - Adds coi-service-worker for cross-origin isolation and deploys to GitHub Pages.
