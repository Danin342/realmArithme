# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
# Summary:
# - Moves export templates into the expected path for the container.
# - Verifies critical assets exist (helps catch case-sensitive path issues on Linux CI).
# - Runs Godot headlessly to (re)import assets so .import metadata exists in CI.
# - Exports using your "Web" preset to build/web/index.html.
# - Adds coi-service-worker and deploys to gh-pages.
